xrestop for Debian
------------------

Please note that, as the upstream README states, xrestop requires the
X-Resource extension, supported by XFree86 4.3 or above, and by the
freedesktop.org X server.

This package does not require that an X server which supports this extension
is installed locally, since you may wish to use it with a remote X server.
